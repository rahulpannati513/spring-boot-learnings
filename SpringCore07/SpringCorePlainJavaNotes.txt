Spring FrameWork:
===============
so far we have learn't 
XML approach
XML + annotation approach
JavaConfig + Annotation
SpringBoot + Annotation

Now we are developing entire only java


-----------------
Java Life Cycle =>
static block,Non Static block(Java Initialization Block), Constructor , method call(setter , business logic ...)then garbage collector

Spring ==> Bean Life Cycle 
Container Started
Voter class loading..
voter is Instantiated
Init
Method call with business logic
Bean Destroyed..
Container is Stopped


static block executed
intamnce and consructor is instila
spring is intilazed obj here
@Postexecuted


Spring==> Bean Life Cycle 
static block,Non static block (Java initialization block), 
Constructor ,init() with @PostConstruct ,
 method call(setter,business logic ..),destroy() @PreDestroy will be last to get executed...


like a normal 

application.properties 
=======================
we use this application properties to use like get the values 

YAML and application.properties are there we can use any one of that...
